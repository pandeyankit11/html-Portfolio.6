<h3>RRR</h3>
<h4>The movie is created in a 3D version which makes it really fascinating to watch.This movie had tried to
    connect the patriortic feelings of Indians against the british rule. </h4>
    <h3>Dhoom 3</h3>
    <h4>One of the finest movie on rivalry of thief and police.The smart techniques used by thief makes 
        this movie unforgetable for anyone.
    </h4>
    <h3>Sholay</h3>
    <h4>One of the oldest gem of Indian cinema is sholay.This movie shows audience everything they want 
        like action, love, drama, true friendship, etc.
